# [](#ABOUT-ME)ABOUT ME
I studied evolutionary biology as an undergraduate at Hampshire College from 2011-2015. I am currently a graduate student In the Bioinformatics and Computational Biology program at the University of Idaho. I am a member of the [CAPS group](http://www.capsidaho.com/). I am interested the genetic basis of Morphogenesis. Here is my [CV](morphogenetics.github.io/cv.pdf)


# [](#Research)Research
My research is centered around understanding how genetic information is translated into morphology.

Specifically, I am interested in:
- Modeling osteocyte migration in developing mouse skulls.
  - How may noisey images be analyzed?
  - How do gene regulatory networks interact to drive the develop of mouse skulls?
- Simulating Morphogenesis:
  - How may cell simulation environments such as GRO be leveraged to create Gene Regulatory Networks(GRN's) with a predefined morphology?
- How slime molds encode memory:
  - It has been shown that slime molds have the capacity to remember the path to an optimal food source. How is this information stored?
  - Can slime molds communicate with each other?
