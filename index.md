# [](#ABOUT-ME)ABOUT ME
I studied evolutionary biology as an undergraduate at Hampshire College from 2011-2015. Currently I am a graduate student in the Bioinformatics and Computational Biology program at the University of Idaho. I am a member of the [CAPS group](http://www.capsidaho.com/). I am interested in the genetic basis of Morphogenesis. Here is my [CV](morphogenetics.github.io/cv.pdf).


# [](#Research)RESEARCH
My research is centered around understanding the ways in image based modeling can be used to better understand morphological processes such as wound healing.

Projects I am currently working on include:
- Modeling osteocyte migration in developing mouse skulls.
  - How may noisey images be analyzed?
  - How do gene regulatory networks interact to drive the development of mouse skulls?
- How slime molds encode memory:
  - It has been shown that slime molds have the capacity to remember the path to an optimal food source. How is this information stored?
  -How do slime mold vascular networks respond to disruption (being fried with a laser), can these responses be predicted via image based modeling?
