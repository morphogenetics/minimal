# [](#ABOUT-ME)ABOUT ME
I studied evolutionary biology as an undergraduate at Hampshire College from 20011-2015. I am currently a graduate student In the Bioinformatics and Computational Biology program at the University of Idaho. I am a member of Kyle Harringtonâ€™s group. I am interested the genetic basis of Morphogenesis.

### [](#Research)Research
My research is centered around understanding how genetic information is translated into  morphology.

Specifically, I am interested in:
- Modeling osteocyte migration in developing mouse skulls.
  - How may noises images be analyzed.
  - How do gene regulatory networks interact to drive the develop of mouse skulls.
- Simulating Morphogenesis
  - How may cell simulation environments such as GRO be leveraged to create Gene Regulatory Networks(GRN's) with a predefined morpholog
- How slime molds encode memory?
  - It has been shown that slime molds have the capacity to remember the path to an optimal food source. How is this information stored?
  - Can slime molds communicate with each other?

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
