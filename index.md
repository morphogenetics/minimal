# [](#ABOUT-ME)ABOUT ME
I studied evolutionary biology as an undergraduate at Hampshire College from 20011-2015. I am currently a graduate student In the Bioinformatics and Computational Biology program at the University of Idaho. I am a member of Kyle Harringtonâ€™s group where I investigate the genetic basis of Morphogenesis.

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### Research
My research is centered around understanding how genetic information is translated into  morphology.

Specifically, I am interested in:
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
